What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	A hidden directory by the name of '.git' is formed which contains metadata
	which is generated by git for the files in repository. It is done to notify
	git that it is a repository which is supposed to be tracked.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	Staging area is an intermediate area if you want to move data from the working
	directory to the repository. You first add data to the staging area and then you
	commit the changes, so only the data in the staging area gets commited. Staging
	area gives you more control by selecting what all data you are going to commit.
