When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
 	Remote repository is used to save work remotly so that even if it is lost form the local
 	machine, it is not lost forever. It makes sharing of code easier.

 Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
 stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
 	Sometimes you would want to decide when is the appropriate time to sync changes or
 	github would end up making many redundant commits. Moreover, you might also want to
 	sync local and remote repositories at all.
