When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
 	Remote repository is used to save work remotly so that even if it is lost form the local
 	machine, it is not lost forever. It makes sharing of code easier.

 Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
 stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
 	Sometimes you would want to decide when is the appropriate time to sync changes or
 	github would end up making many redundant commits. Moreover, you might also want to
 	sync local and remote repositories at all

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead
of another?
	Forks are used to clone someone else's repository in your own on Github. Clones are same
	as forks except they can be anywhere instead of necessarily being on Github. Branches are
	literal brances of the repository tree. They are used to work on different versions of a
	same repository simultaneously.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	It gives you a basis of comparison that you made after doing your last pull from the remote.
